### Step one - Finding a Visualization

I selected this particular visualization for a few reasons. First, I am interested in the subject and it is quite relevant given the recent passage of the infrastructure bill. Second, I felt that this visualization was quite strong overall, but could be improved with some minor tweaks. The color scheme looks clean and the message of the visualization is clear. However, I also noticed large amounts of text which we recently discussed in class as a sign that the graph may not be conveying its message as clearly as it could be. I also felt that the "support", "oppose", and "net" sections were a bit awkward and out of place. Finally, I felt there was room to simplify the visualization while still conveying the main idea.

### Step Two - Critique

For my critique, I tried to take note of my initial impressions and examine how those impressions fit into the Stephen Few critique framework. My overall initial impression was quite positive. I felt that the message communicated was clear and the legend and axes relatively easy to understand. However, I felt there were some visual cues that could be improved and that the layout could be simplified while still retaining the overall theme. For example, the red-blue color scheme instinctually caused me to assume these shadings represented political party affiliation. This is likely because the article mentioned Democrat and Republican support both immediately preceding, and immediately after this visualization. Moreover, the other visualization in the article used a similar color scheme, but this scheme actually did represent party affiliation. My remaining critiques centered around the clarity of the visualization. I felt that there was too much text on the page and too much color. As I thought about it further, I realized that the "support", "oppose" and "net" sections of the visualization were actually the most important. These sections clearly expressed the wide margins by which likely voters supported taxation of the wealthy and large corporations to pay for the Build Back Better Plan. Paradoxically, I felt that this section was actually de-emphasized, with the focus being on the shaded bars. Thus, I knew that in my wireframing and final visualization, I would want to emphasize this part of the data rather than each specific survey response.

### Step Three - Wireframing

When I was wireframing, I initially thought about completely re-visualizing the way this information was displayed. I began creating an area chart, in the hopes of more strongly visually emphasizing the overwhelming support for taxing the wealthy to pay for the infrastructure bill. Unfortunately, the area chart seemed to be a poor fit for this type of data. The lines erroneously suggested that there was some sort of time element involved, even though there is no passage of time with this data.
