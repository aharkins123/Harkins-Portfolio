# Final Project Part I

## Outline

With my final project, I am interested in investigating the outsized influence of dark money groups and Political Action Committees on our political discourse and outcomes. In particular, I would like to focus on the political donations of the NRA and other gun rights groups, and how those donations may influence elected officials to vote against gun control legislation despite overall public support for such legislation. Below, I have laid out an anticipated storyline, along with sketches made in Flourish (with made up data). 

**The Setup** 

Introduce the general idea that political contributions are dominated by wealthy individuals and Political Action Committees. Begin with an overall view, showing that small individual contributions make up a miniscule percentage of overall contributions, indicating that PAC's and wealthy individuals may have an outsized influence on political discourse and outcomes.

**The Conflict**

From there, introduce the true conflict and focus of this project. Drill down to two very simple graphics: (1) The overall domination of gun rights spending compared to gun control spending and (2) how the NRA's Victory Fund contributed $20 million to this effort in 2020 alone.

Add some specificity to this conflict potentially by depicting the Senators/Representatives to which the NRA contributes the most money. 

**The Resolution**

While not entirely a resolution, present survey information from Gallup indicating that there is public support for gun control legislation. Display how recent gun control groups have actually outspent gun rights groups. Finally, introduce options to support making elections more fair and accessible through the organization Common Cause.

## The Data 

To first introduce the general idea of political contributions and where they come from, I plan to use [this simple dataset](https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/where-the-money-came-from) from OpenSecrets. This features a percentage breakdown of source of funds for House/Senate Democrats and Republicans, broken into PACS, Large individuals contributions, small individual contributions, and self-financing. 

[OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/guns/) also has several datasets available that feature information such as top recipients of funds from gun rights groups and total lobbying money spent on gun control vs. gun rights. This [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-7PdCI2NawSgP1QE-cGYVYedetYqepR-4jBweaJyqFo/edit#gid=0) contains this information for both 2020 and 2016. 

Finally, while this isn't exactly a dataset, Gallup publishes results of public opinion polls on various issues, including gun policy. I plan to use some combination of the responses featured [here](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx) to reflect public opinion on gun control legislation.

## Method and Medium

I am unsure yet which medium would be best for presenting this information. I have been using ArcGIS StoryMaps this semester in GIS with Professor Kurland, so I think that would be a viable option for presenting this data. However, based on a review of some Shorthand stories, Shorthand has a more visually appealing setup than StoryMaps. Therefore, I think I am most likely to present this information through Shorthand.

As for the steps to project completion, the first step will be examining the data I have more closely and identifying potential visual styles for presenting that data. I want my message to be clear, so my sketches here are all in fairly simple visual form - however, the data is more complicated than what I have presented here. I may explore if there is a room for a less common visual that provides greater detail, such as a racing bar graph that depicts NRA contributions relative to other organizations year over year. After examining the data more closely, I will finalize my sketches. From there, I will need to explore sites like Unsplash and Flickr Creative Commons to identify visuals that may reinforce my storytelling. I probably want to draw a balance between using evocative imagery without showing anything overtly violent or triggering. Finally, I plan to workshop my final project with at least a few friends to ascertain where my story falls flat. I will create a script similar to the script used in Assignments 3 and 4, with questions such as: "Is there anything you want to know that isn't answered here?" and "What part of the story did you find most compelling? Least compelling?". 

After the feedback sessions, I will rework my final visualizations and story progression. If reviewers identify any missing information that seems absolutely crucial to the story, I may review my data sources to see how best that piece of the story can be told.
