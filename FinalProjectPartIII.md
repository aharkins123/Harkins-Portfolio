## [Final Data Story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/guns-and-money/index.html)

### Reflection

I began this project by searching for topics that piqued my interest that had plenty of data available to work with. I found myself looking through the OpenSecrets website, as OpenSecrets often has interesting information on political contributions. One topic in particular jumped out – financial contributions from gun rights and gun control groups. OpenSecrets published a dataset that contained tons of information on political contributions from lobbying groups, PACs, and the National Rifle Association in particular. I decided to pursue a project that would tell a story, starting with the big picture of political contributions, and narrowing down to gun rights organizations and the NRA.

After I had a general story in mind, I worked on outlining. Without looking too closely at the data so as not to hinder my creativity when developing visualizations, I began drafting visualizations based on what I imagined the data might say. I used Flourish and made-up data to portray a general story. The idea was to introduce how PACs and wealthy individuals make up most of political contributions. From there, I wanted to discuss the political contributions of the NRA and gun rights groups specifically. Finally, I wanted to introduce how the domination of gun rights money in politics is at odds with the opinion of the general public, which favors stricter gun control laws. Some of my initial storyboard efforts appear almost unchanged in my final version, while others were scrapped altogether. This visualization, for example, did not make it to the final version.

Next, I began storyboarding. I began storyboarding in Flourish in order to familiarize myself with the different options available. In hindsight, it may have been better to storyboard just by sketching. I tend to limit myself based on a medium’s capabilities. Regardless, I tried to make my storyboard as detailed as close to a final version as possible in order to gather meaningful feedback. I developed several visualizations using the datasets I collected and typed up some barebones text to give the story some structure.

Next, I gathered feedback on my storyboard. This process was extremely helpful. My main takeaway from gathering feedback was that I had a story in my mind, but that I had not necessarily translated that story into Shorthand. I also greatly benefited from seeing how other students used Shorthand to facilitate their storytelling. In particular, I focused on using title slides with relevant images to separate each piece of my story. Originally, my storyboard felt a bit jumbled with no clear transition from one subject to the next. 

From there, I incorporated the feedback and completed my final project. Several interviewees expressed interest in seeing how gun rights vs. gun control contributions are split along party lines. In order to include that element in the story, I included a dot plot that expressed total NRA contributions to candidates, with virtually all Republican candidates receiving some amount of money from the NRA, while all Democratic candidates received “negative” contributions (the NRA spent money to oppose these candidates). I included an annotation at $0 to show the sharp divide in contributions to party members, used blue and red to symbolize party affiliation, and also made sure that Democrats were on the “left” side of the graph while Republicans were on the right side. 

I also simplified my presentation in terms of design. Originally, I was using several scrollmation columns, incorporating tons of pictures, and varying text placement on the right, middle, and left sides. I decided that this felt too complicated, so I simplified my presentation to have all text sections in the middle column with no background pictures. I reserved the pictures only for the transition slides, which I think actually increases the impact of the images I selected since there are only six throughout the entire presentation. 

Finally, I gathered one last round of feedback from a friend on my final presentation. Based on this feedback, I included a “hook” where I begin by stating that America is an “exceptional” nation, but quickly turn that concept on its head by stating that America is exceptionally violent compared to other countries.
