# Final Project Part II

## Storyboard

I decided to storyboard my final project in Shorthand to get some early practice with the different features. I definitely need to experiment more with different options (scrollmations, column placement etc.) for the final product, but this layout gives a general indication of my story progression. I also think I need to demarcate clearer sections, because at the moment it feels like one long blob of text/visualizations rather than a story with unique sections.

## User Research Protocol

#### Target Audience

I hope to reach a general audience of concerned citizens and individuals interested in effecting policy change, with a focus on younger generations. This will require me to provide some background information and additional explanation, which may lead to a more text-heavy final project. Thus, it will be essential to explain concepts clearly and concisely in order not to drown the viewer in text so that they can glean most of the information from the visualizations.

#### Interviewees

Since I have a rather broad general audience, I selected my interviewees in order to represent a diverse array of backgrounds. While I interviewed a diverse group of candidates based on gender, race, and professional background, all my interviewees are in their mid-20's and are currently students. Thus, for future user feedback, I may be interested in finding somewhat younger or older candidates, as well as candidates who are currently working.

**Interviewee 1:** Interviewee 1 is a 24-year old female who is a current law student with a background as a legal assistant

**Interviewee 2:** Interviewee 2 is a 26-year old female who is a current Heinz student

**Interviewee 3:** Intervieweee 3 is a 27-year old male who is a current medical student

#### Script

1. What is your initial impression? As you scroll through, what catches your eye the most? 

2. What do you think the point of this is?

3. Who do you think is the intended audience?

4. Visually, what do you find distracting or out of place? How do you feel about the color scheme?

5. Conceptually, do the visualizations reinforce the overall message? Are there certain visualizations that you found confusing?

6. What would you like to see that isn't represented here?

#### Findings

The main takeaways from my interviews are as follows. First, users seem to grasp the point of the overall project fairly quickly. I think this may be in part due to the fact that it is a somewhat familiar topic, especially with the news coverage that shootings get. Given that this topic is largely familiar, I may be able to delve a bit deeper into the subject matter. Second, all three users expressed an interest in some sort of visualization that expresses the partisan divide in NRA/Gun Rights contributions to politicians. My initial impression is that this comparison would be best represented through a scatterplot, although there may be an opportunity for more unique visualizations such as a beeswarm or a connected dot plot. Third, I will need to resolve some issues on Shorthand layout. Users seemed to have trouble with positioning of certain elements, i.e. some graphs are too large, some of the sections don't flow well from one to another, some of the background pictures need to be adjusted. Finally, I need to refine and standardize elements of the visaulizations. For example, I need to ensure that axis titles are there when necessary, I need to standardize fonts, and I need to add titles where appropriate.

**Transcribed Responses**

**Interviewee 1:**

1. Overall I like it, lots of dynamic screens, although I do feel like the ones that take up the full screen are kind of hard to see/grasp bc they’re so wide. I also don’t love having something just on one side of the screen/always having it on the same side

2. Gun rights lobbyists have had a lot of power in politics but gun control efforts might finally be giving them a run for their money

3. General public? Students? Potential lobbyists? Activists/organizers?

4. Visually distracting/out of place: America is exceptionally violent seems out of place; the big "through three pacs" number is too big and I don’t like the font. It also runs into the stuff around it I just don’t like it; the coin background in the beginning doesn’t hit at the right time and is kind of distracting because it doesn't last very long before it flips to the next background; I don’t like that the first pie chart only has two colors when there are four categories (although I understand why)

5. Appropriateness of visualizations: the very last one took me a second to understand — maybe add a clearer title ?

6. What would you like to see: tbh interested in the % of Ds/Rs that gun rights lobbyists donate to; re NRA donations: what’s, like, a normal amount to donate? Like how does the NRA compare to other PACs?

**Interviewee 2:**

1. The tone is pretty ominous overall -- dark colors, lots of red, first impression is that this issue is something quite dire / serious. The information about super PAC donations definitely caught my eye the most, as did the enormous jump in lobbying money in 2013 -- possibly because they're dynamic images? Honestly a pretty nifty way to get someone's attention. 

2. The point is to show the NRA's outsized influence on our policymaking process -- as the tone of the presentation would indicate, the NRA has a significant, negative influence on our democracy, and have the monetary backing to make that happen.  

3. My guess would be folks who are not quite civically engaged, but could be persuaded to care about this issue. It seems like it's targeting laypersons rather than decision makers themselves. 

4. The color scheme is great -- love the use of party colors to prove your point about how this actually plays out as policy. It's a little dark / could use some more "negative space" -- I'm viewing it on a laptop and it feels a bit overwhelming since the visualizations take up the entire screen. I would recommend making use of side panels if you can, just to give your viewer a little breathing room between all your visualizations. I love the lobbying timeline, but maybe it could process just a little faster -- it takes a while to get to the jump, and I'm not sure everyone has the patience to wait for it! I'd also like to see percentages themselves in the doughnut charts if it doesn't make them look too cluttered -- hovering over them takes more time. 

5. The visualizations do a great job of getting your point across -- they're impactful, and quite easy to read. I'd give the bar chart a title if you can -- I know the information is in the text body, but it never hurts to reinforce the information (also massive yikes re: Mitt Romney) 

6. I'd like to see a dot chart of representatives receiving NRA contributions -- I'm sure there's a partisan divide, but I'd love to see what that actually looks like proportionally with each individual represented as a point. 

**Interviewee 3:** 

1. Generally, like it. Feels like a webpage. Like the racing graph, big fan of that. The penny to gun, bullet thing caught my eye, I don’t know if that’s what you want. 
Also like the tides graph but could be smaller. 

2. It feels like some version of liberal gun control information. More informational, mostly just anti-NRA. Finish on an NRA note and not how much gun control vs. gun rights. 

3. Left-leaning individuals interested in gun control and political spending.

4. That thing in the middle, the big bar countdown. The color on the pie chart felt a little out of place. If the ticker had a bigger bar on the top and bottom it would probably be more eye-catching. Once someone sees it, it fades in or out so you can see the countdown at all times. Like the color scheme, black and red works pretty well, teal for control stands out against background. Matches the sign on the title slide. Purposefully didn’t look at gray. 

5.
•	Add title to bar graph
•	Something about this last section doesn’t jive for me. Like the black background for the pie chart.
•	What if the tide chart was half the size, could probably put that next to the bar chart, have a slider that show contributions per year to representative
