### Step Two - Critique

I felt that the message communicated was clear and the legend and axes relatively easy to understand. However, I felt there were some visual cues that could be improved and that the layout could be simplified while still retaining the overall theme.

My remaining critiques centered around the clarity of the visualization. I felt that there was too much text on the page and too much color. As I thought about it further, I realized that the "support",
