# About Me
Hi! My name is Alec Harkins and I am a second-year MSPPM student. My pronouns are he/him. I am from the Washington, D.C. area and went to Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA. I then returned to the D.C. area and worked as an insider trading investigator for four years before coming to Heinz. Policy-wise, I am interested in issues related to education, voting rights, and financial regulation. For fun, I enjoy playing soccer, rock climbing, reading books/news, and finding new cafes to try. 

I completed my first year of the program remotely from D.C., so the last couple months have been exciting what with in-person classes and moving to a new city. I am trying to make the most of my remaining year in-person by exploring Pittsburgh as much as possible. 

# What I Hope to Learn

I feel like the MSPPM core classes helped me a more responsible reader and interpreter of data for myself. However, I do not feel like I have learned how to properly use data to communicate something to a third-party, which is a very different task. On top of that, I do not think that I am particularly creative, so I often feel that I am anchored to generic Excel graphs when I think about visualizing something. I hope to first learn how to properly communicate data to a specific party, as I feel that is an essential task for a policy analyst hoping to communicate an important idea to someone who probably doesn't have much time. Second, I want to get better at thinking outside of the box - I want to develop unique visualizations based on my data rather than simply trying to fit what I have into the visual forms I am used to seeing. Ultimately, I hope to employ these skills as a policy analyst for a federal government agency.
