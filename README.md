# About Me
Hi! My name is Alec Harkins and I am a second-year MSPPM student. My pronouns are he/him. I am from the Washington, D.C. area and went to Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA. I then returned to the D.C. area and worked as an insider trading investigator for four years before coming to Heinz. Policy-wise, I am interested in issues related to education, voting rights, and financial regulation. For fun, I enjoy playing soccer, rock climbing, reading books/news, and finding new cafes to try. 

I completed my first year of the program remotely from D.C., so the last couple months have been exciting what with in-person classes and moving to a new city. I am trying to make the most of my remaining year in-person by exploring Pittsburgh as much as possible. 

# What I Hope to Learn

I feel like the MSPPM core classes helped me a more responsible reader and interpreter of data for myself. However, I do not feel like I have learned how to properly use data to communicate something to a third-party, which is a very different task. On top of that, I do not think that I am particularly creative, so I often feel that I am anchored to generic Excel graphs when I think about visualizing something. I hope to first learn how to properly communicate data to a specific party, as I feel that is an essential task for a policy analyst hoping to communicate an important idea to someone who probably doesn't have much time. Second, I want to get better at thinking outside of the box - I want to develop unique visualizations based on my data rather than simply trying to fit what I have into the visual forms I am used to seeing. Ultimately, I hope to employ these skills as a policy analyst for a federal government agency.

## [Assignment Two]

### Part One

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6vsN" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2018</iframe>

### Part Two - Grid of Line Charts

Displayed here is a grid of line charts for the debt-to-GDP ratio for 47 countries. The y-axis details the debt-to-GDP ratio (as a percent) and the x-axis depicts the year, ranging from 1995 to 2020. Viewers might take note of the rapidly increasing ratios for countries such as Japan and Greece.

### Part Two - Own Visualization

Displayed below is a scatterplot of each country's debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2020. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/7691304"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This method of visualization, compared to the first grid of line charts, gives a better sense of the overall movement in debt-to-gdp ratio over time. While the first visualization provided users the ability to instantly spot a country and see its individual debt-to-GDP ratio over time, the big picture was lost with the separate grid of 47 line charts. For this reason, I created a scatterplot that does not color the points by country, but does quickly give viewers an idea of the spread of debt-to-gdp ratios over time. Moreso than the first visualization, this allows the viewer to quickly recognize that the overall spread of debt-to-gdp ratios has increased over time, starting at a minimum of around 10% and a maximum of 140%, and moving to a minimum of around 25% and a maximum of around 250%. To reinforce this understanding of overall movement in debt-to-gdp ratios, I included a trend line that shows the slight increase in overall debt-to-gdp ratios over time. 

While this scatter plot visualization loses some of the specificity provided by the first visualization, I included an interactive filter that allows users to select a specific country to display. This way, viewers who are still interested in finding details about a specific country's debt-to-ratio can do so. While Flourish automatically adjusts axes for these filtered scatterplots, I opted to not allow the y-axis to shift depending on the country being viewed. This allows the viewer to filter by country but still have a solid understanding of where that country's debt-to-gdp ratio falls relative to all other countries in the dataset.

### Step one - Finding a Visualization

I selected this particular visualization for a few reasons. First, I am interested in the subject and it is quite relevant given the recent passage of the infrastructure bill. Second, I felt that this visualization was quite strong overall, but could be improved with some minor tweaks. The color scheme looks clean and the message of the visualization is clear. However, I also noticed large amounts of text which we recently discussed in class as a sign that the graph may not be conveying its message as clearly as it could be. I also felt that the "support", "oppose", and "net" sections were a bit awkward and out of place. Finally, I felt there was room to simplify the visualization while still conveying the main idea.

### Step Two - Critique

For my critique, I tried to take note of my initial impressions and examine how those impressions fit into the Stephen Few critique framework. My overall initial impression was quite positive. I felt that the message communicated was clear and the legend and axes relatively easy to understand. However, I felt there were some visual cues that could be improved and that the layout could be simplified while still retaining the overall theme. For example, the red-blue color scheme instinctually caused me to assume these shadings represented political party affiliation. This is likely because the article mentioned Democrat and Republican support both immediately preceding, and immediately after this visualization. Moreover, the other visualization in the article used a similar color scheme, but this scheme actually did represent party affiliation. My remaining critiques centered around the clarity of the visualization. I felt that there was too much text on the page and too much color. As I thought about it further, I realized that the "support",
