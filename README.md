# About Me
Hi! My name is Alec Harkins and I am a second-year MSPPM student. My pronouns are he/him. I am from the Washington, D.C. area and went to Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA. I then returned to the D.C. area and worked as an insider trading investigator for four years before coming to Heinz. I completed my first year of the program remotely from D.C., so the last couple months have been exciting what with in-person classes and moving to a new city. I am trying to make the most of my remaining year in-person by exploring Pittsburgh as much as possible. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, rock climbing, reading books/news, and finding new cafes to try.
